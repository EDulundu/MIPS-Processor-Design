# MIPS-Processor-Design
In this First_Project, I used Altera Quartus II with Verilog. I designed a part of 
the 32- bit MIPS processor. The block that I designed get an 32-bit instruction 
as its input and compute the resultant value and stores it to the destination 
register given by the instruction. The only supported instructions in my design 
add, sub, and, or, sra, srl, sll, sltu and addi, addiu, andi, ori, slti, lui instructions.

In this Final Project,I used Altera Quartus II with Verilog. The block that I designed 
will get no inputs from outside. I designed two additional memories: Data Memory and 
Instruction Memory. The instructions loaded to the instruction memory and the data was
in data memory. I added xor,xori, slt, sltiu, lw, lb, sw, sb, j, jal, jr, beq and bne 
instructions to my previous design.
